\section{Introduction}

In bin/tests there is the file options.db3. You should copy it in the
directory bin as ''cp options.db3.. /.', and then you launch the code
after the load is appear four test configurations that allow you to
see all the options in action.


\section{Test1}

The aim of test1 is to test a simple case and many options of the code
to validate them. Figure~\ref{test1conf} shows the options of the
chosen configuration.

The following figures show the results obtained. The plots are done
with Matlab and these are directly the eps files from the ifdda.m
script that are used. The advantage of matlab in this case is to give
all the figures in one go.

Because the incident field is polarized along the $y$ direction (TE),
hence the $y$ component of the field inside the sphere is the largest.

\section{Test2}

The aim of the test2 is to test a more complex case.  Figure~
\ref{test2conf} shows the options of the chosen configuration. The
illumination is done with a Gaussian beam with $w_0=\lambda$ and the
object under study is a sphere with a radius of 500~nm and an
inhomogeneous permittivity ($l_c=100$~nm and $\sigma=0.1$).
