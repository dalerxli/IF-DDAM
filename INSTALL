Linux installation:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application is based on Qt-4.8 and gfortran

To install it, first you need to:

1) install the Qt packages as root:
yum install qt qt-devel

2) install gcc-c++ and gfortran as root
yum install gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran

3) at root directory
qmake-qt4
make
make install

To run the application:
cd bin
./cdm

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows installation:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application is based on Qt and MinGW and OpenGL

To build and install it, you need to:

1) install the Qt (5.0 or higher) with OpenGl and MinGW options including the QtCreator IDE

2) Open cmd_install.pro file in the root directory with QtCreator.exe

3) Build full project. You can run the executable cdm.exe directly from QtCreator.

4) To run the application in stand-alone, you need to deploy it along with a few runtime libraries.
For example if you built with Qt 5.3 (OpenGL included) and MinGW-4.8.2 option, 
the list of dll (in the Qt and MinGW-4.8.2 lib subdirectories) 
that have to be present in the same directory as cdm.exe:
icudt52.dll
icuin52.dll
icuuc52.dll
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libgfortran-3.dll
libquadmath-0.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5OpenGL.dll
Qt5PrintSupport.dll
Qt5Sql.dll
Qt5Svg.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll
